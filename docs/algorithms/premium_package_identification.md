### Secondary Goals
- **Completeness**: Identify packages even with partial or missing data
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform package naming and classification
- **Explainability**: Provide clear reasoning for each identification decision
- **Auditability**: Enable full traceability of identification logic

### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy Rate**: ≥95% correct identification vs ground truth
- **Coverage Rate**: ≥90% of vehicles receive package identification
- **Confidence Calibration**: High-confidence predictions (>0.8) achieve ≥98% accuracy
- **Processing Speed**: <100ms average identification time per vehicle

## Input Data Sources

### Primary Inputs

#### 1. RPO (Regular Production Option) Codes
- **Description**: Manufacturer-specific option codes (e.g., GM RPO codes like "1SZ", "PDL")
- **Format**: Alphanumeric codes (typically 2-4 characters)
- **Reliability**: High (manufacturer-direct)
- **Coverage**: Varies by manufacturer (GM: extensive, others: limited)

#### 2. Build Sheets
- **Description**: Factory production documents with ordered options
- **Format**: Structured data with option codes and descriptions
- **Reliability**: Very High (authoritative source)
- **Coverage**: Limited availability (newer vehicles, specific dealers)

#### 3. Window Stickers (Monroney Labels)
- **Description**: Federally mandated pricing labels with equipment lists
- **Format**: Semi-structured text with package names and individual options
- **Reliability**: High (regulatory requirement)
- **Coverage**: Good for new vehicles, limited for used

#### 4. Decoded VIN Attributes

```

### Normalization Process

#### 1. Text Standardization
- Convert all text to uppercase
- Remove special characters and extra whitespace
- Standardize abbreviations (e.g., "PKG" → "PACKAGE", "PREM" → "PREMIUM")
- Handle manufacturer-specific terminology variations

#### 2. Equipment Mapping
- Map individual options to standard equipment categories
- Handle option bundling variations across manufacturers
- Resolve conflicting or duplicate equipment listings
- Apply manufacturer-specific business rules

#### 3. Package Name Standardization
- Map manufacturer package names to canonical taxonomy
- Handle regional naming variations (e.g., "Luxury Package" vs "Premium Package")
- Resolve ambiguous package names using context

## Rules Engine and Confidence Scoring

### Rule Categories

#### 1. Direct Mapping Rules (Weight: 1.0)
```python
# Example: Direct RPO code mapping
if rpo_codes.contains("1SZ"):
    packages.add("Premium Luxury Package")
    confidence += 0.95
```

#### 2. Equipment-Based Rules (Weight: 0.8)
```python
# Example: Equipment combination rules
luxury_equipment = [
    "heated_steering_wheel",
    "ventilated_seats", 
    "premium_audio",
    "navigation_system"
]
if equipment_match_ratio(luxury_equipment) >= 0.75:
    packages.add("Luxury Package")
    confidence += 0.80 * equipment_match_ratio(luxury_equipment)
```

#### 3. Context-Aware Rules (Weight: 0.6)
```python
# Example: Trim-level context
if trim_level == "Limited" and has_equipment("premium_wheels"):
    packages.add("Appearance Package")
    confidence += 0.60
```

#### 4. Probabilistic Rules (Weight: 0.4)
```python
# Example: Statistical inference
if manufacturer == "BMW" and price_range == "luxury":
    package_probability = calculate_historical_probability(
        year, model, trim, equipment_list
    )
    if package_probability > 0.7:
        confidence += 0.40 * package_probability
```

### Confidence Calculation

#### Base Confidence Formula
```
confidence = Σ(rule_weight × rule_confidence × rule_match_score) / total_applicable_rules
```

#### Confidence Modifiers
- **Data Quality Bonus**: +0.05 for high-quality input data
- **Multiple Source Bonus**: +0.10 for corroborating evidence from multiple sources
- **Manufacturer Expertise Bonus**: +0.05 for well-covered manufacturers
- **Uncertainty Penalty**: -0.15 for conflicting evidence
- **Incomplete Data Penalty**: -0.10 for missing critical data elements

#### Confidence Thresholds
- **High Confidence**: ≥0.80 (Recommend for automatic processing)
- **Medium Confidence**: 0.60-0.79 (Flag for review)
- **Low Confidence**: 0.40-0.59 (Require manual validation)
- **No Confidence**: <0.40 (Unable to identify reliably)

### Example Scoring Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: High Confidence (0.88)
```
Input: GM vehicle with RPO codes "1SZ", "PDL", build sheet present
- Direct RPO mapping: +0.95 (weight 1.0)
- Build sheet confirmation: +0.90 (weight 1.0)  
- Data quality bonus: +0.05
- Multiple source bonus: +0.10
Final: (0.95 + 0.90)/2 + 0.15 = 0.925 → 0.88 (capped)
```

#### Scenario 2: Medium Confidence (0.67)
```
Input: Window sticker with "Premium Package" listed, some equipment data
- Package name match: +0.70 (weight 0.8)
- Equipment confirmation: +0.65 (weight 0.8)
- Incomplete data penalty: -0.10
Final: (0.70 + 0.65) × 0.8 - 0.10 = 0.67
```

## Explainability Model and Audit Logging

### Decision Explanation Framework

#### 1. Rule Attribution
Each identification decision includes:
- **Primary Evidence**: The strongest supporting evidence
- **Supporting Evidence**: Additional corroborating factors
- **Confidence Factors**: What increased/decreased confidence
- **Alternative Interpretations**: Other possible package identifications considered

#### 2. Human-Readable Explanations
```json
{
  "package_identified": "Sport Performance Package",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "explanation": {
    "primary_evidence": "RPO code 'Z51' directly maps to Sport Performance Package",
    "supporting_evidence": [
      "Performance suspension components detected",
      "Sport wheels and tires confirmed",
      "Enhanced braking system present"
    ],
    "confidence_factors": {
      "positive": [
        "Direct RPO mapping (+0.95)",
        "Equipment confirmation (+0.80)",
        "High data quality (+0.05)"
      ],
      "negative": [
        "Single source data (-0.05)"
      ]
    },
    "alternatives_considered": [
      "Appearance Package (confidence: 0.34)",
      "Track Package (confidence: 0.28)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Edge Cases and Fallback Heuristics

### Common Edge Cases

#### 1. Conflicting Data Sources
**Problem**: Different sources suggest different packages
**Solution**: 
- Apply source reliability weighting
- Look for partial overlaps in equipment lists
- Use manufacturer-specific tie-breaking rules
- Flag for manual review if confidence drops below threshold

#### 2. Partial Package Implementation
**Problem**: Some but not all package equipment is present
**Solution**:
- Calculate equipment match percentages
- Apply "core equipment" rules (some items more indicative than others)
- Consider factory deletion options and regional variations
- Provide "partial package" classifications

#### 3. Regional/Market Variations
**Problem**: Same package has different equipment in different markets
**Solution**:
- Maintain market-specific package definitions
- Use vehicle build location and intended market
- Apply region-aware equipment mapping rules

#### 4. Limited/Special Edition Packages
**Problem**: Rare packages not in standard taxonomy
**Solution**:
- Maintain special edition database
- Use production number/sequence analysis
- Apply statistical rarity detection
- Escalate to expert review queue

### Fallback Heuristics

#### 1. Equipment-Only Identification (No Package Codes)
```python
def equipment_based_fallback(equipment_list):
    equipment_signatures = get_package_signatures()
    best_match = None
    best_score = 0
    
    for package, signature in equipment_signatures.items():
        score = calculate_equipment_overlap(equipment_list, signature)
        if score > best_score and score > MINIMUM_EQUIPMENT_THRESHOLD:
            best_match = package
            best_score = score
    
    return best_match, best_score * FALLBACK_CONFIDENCE_PENALTY
```

#### 2. Statistical Model Fallback
```python
def statistical_fallback(vehicle_attributes):
    # Use historical data to predict likely packages
    similar_vehicles = find_similar_vehicles(
        year=vehicle_attributes.year,
        make=vehicle_attributes.make,
        model=vehicle_attributes.model,
        trim=vehicle_attributes.trim
    )
    
    package_probabilities = calculate_package_distribution(similar_vehicles)
    return select_most_probable_packages(
        package_probabilities, 
        confidence_threshold=STATISTICAL_THRESHOLD
    )
```

#### 3. Trim-Level Inference
```python
def trim_level_fallback(trim_level, manufacturer):
    # Use trim level to infer likely packages
    trim_package_map = get_trim_package_mappings(manufacturer)
    
    if trim_level in trim_package_map:
        likely_packages = trim_package_map[trim_level]
        return [(pkg, TRIM_INFERENCE_CONFIDENCE) for pkg in likely_packages]
    
    return []
```
