# ADR-001: Adopt Domain-Driven Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The VIN Decoder Bot needs to handle complex business logic around vehicle identification, user management, and integration with multiple external services. The initial implementation was becoming difficult to maintain with business logic scattered across different modules.

### Problem Statement
- Business logic mixed with infrastructure concerns
- Difficult to test business rules in isolation
- Unclear boundaries between different functional areas
- Hard to onboard new developers due to lack of structure

### Requirements
- Clear separation of business logic from technical implementation
- Testable business rules
- Maintainable and evolvable architecture
- Support for multiple VIN decoder services

## Decision
We will adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to structure the application.

### Bounded Contexts
1. **Vehicle Context**: Everything related to VIN decoding and vehicle information
2. **User Context**: User preferences, history, and settings management
3. **Messaging Context**: Telegram-specific interaction logic
4. **Integration Context**: External API integrations and adapters

### Key DDD Patterns Applied
- **Entities**: Vehicle, User (with unique identities)
- **Value Objects**: VIN, VehicleID, UserID, TelegramID
- **Aggregates**: User aggregate (includes preferences and history)
- **Domain Events**: VehicleDecoded, UserRegistered, PreferencesUpdated
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract persistence behind interfaces
- **Domain Services**: Complex business logic not fitting entities

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear boundaries**: Each bounded context has well-defined responsibilities
- **Business focus**: Domain model reflects real business concepts
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested without infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Easy to change infrastructure without affecting domain
- **Team scalability**: Different teams can work on different contexts
- **Documentation**: Code structure documents the business domain

### Negative
- **Initial complexity**: More files and abstractions upfront
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand DDD concepts
- **Over-engineering risk**: Might be overkill for simple features
- **Mapping overhead**: Need to map between layers (DTOs, entities)

### Neutral
- **Performance**: Additional abstraction layers have minimal impact
- **Development speed**: Slower initially, faster for complex features

## Implementation

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── domain/           # Pure business logic
│   ├── vehicle/     # Vehicle bounded context
│   ├── user/        # User bounded context
│   └── shared/      # Shared kernel
├── application/     # Use cases and orchestration
├── infrastructure/  # External integrations
└── presentation/    # User interfaces
```

### Example: Vehicle Entity
```python
@dataclass
class Vehicle:
    id: VehicleID
    vin: VIN
    info: VehicleInfo
    decoded_at: datetime
    source: DecoderSource
    
    def update_info(self, new_info: VehicleInfo) -> None:
        """Domain logic for updating vehicle information."""
        self.info = self.info.merge(new_info)
        self._raise_event(VehicleInfoUpdated(self.id, self.info))
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Transaction Script Pattern
- **Pros**: Simple, straightforward for CRUD operations
- **Cons**: Business logic scattered, hard to maintain complex rules
- **Reason rejected**: Insufficient for complex business logic

### 2. Active Record Pattern
- **Pros**: Simple ORM integration, less boilerplate
- **Cons**: Couples domain to persistence, hard to test
- **Reason rejected**: Violates separation of concerns

### 3. Service Layer Pattern Only
- **Pros**: Some separation, simpler than DDD
- **Cons**: Anemic domain model, logic in services
- **Reason rejected**: Loses rich domain modeling benefits
